# Urban Soundscape Harmonizer

AI-Driven Acoustic Environment Optimizer for Urban Areas

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI system that analyzes urban sound patterns, identifies sources of noise pollution, and generates real-time interventions to optimize the urban soundscape using simulated IoT acoustic sensors, machine learning for sound classification, and basic generative techniques to create sound masking solutions.
